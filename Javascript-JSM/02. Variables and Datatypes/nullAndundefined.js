// The null type has only one value, null
const age = null;
console.log(age);

// The undefined type means there is no value assigned to the variable, by default when a variable is created but its value is not set, it is said to be undefined.
let x = undefined; // or, only let x;
console.log(x, typeof x);
console.log(typeof age); // object, beacuse the type of null is object 

// javascript never sets a value to null, but by default it sets a value to undefined for a variable
